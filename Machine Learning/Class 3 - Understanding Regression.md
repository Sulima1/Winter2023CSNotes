- **Bias** - our model is inflexible and not following the model as it should be
- **Variance** - flexbility captured by the model 

- The more flexible a regression model is the less biased it is

- To make a judgement about a regression model look at the F-statistic
	- If it is less than 0.5 reject the null hypothesis then at least 1 of the parameters is good for making predicitons
